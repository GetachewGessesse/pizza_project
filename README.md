# pizza_project
*****************************************************************

This is pizza project code written by Getachew Gessesse.

My ID is 346369507.

This project will enable the user to choose pizza size according to their
price. In addition to this, there is a discount for pizzas according to lotto
playing game.

I used python 3 and pycharm to write the code.
This project has three main parts named: pizza_apps, pizza_main and pizza_utiles.
On pizza_apps file there is the main code of the project, on pizza_main file,
there is call for every function and on pizza_utiles, there is help function 
called random inorder to help the customer to play luck game and get discount.

At the end of the program, the program calculates the total price of the pizza
orders with the discount value and gives result for the customers.
